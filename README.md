## 📦 Getting Started

### How do I use `that module`?

Examples are kept in the examples folder, Quick, practical scripts showing how to use each module.

### General usage

To find the functions, Use your editor’s **find-in-all** function *(shift+ctrl+f in vsc)* or just browse through the files.

> VSkript for VSCode also provides documentation formatting on hover, so I use this when using mib_lib.

## 📖 FAQ

### Why no Skript Addon D:?
I wanted to keep this pure Skript so you can learn from the libraries and easily change whatever you want.

### Can I use only some modules?
Absolutely. Copy out what you need, or keep the full set for convenience.

### Why snake_case?
It's personal preference for me since I work in game engines that use this casing, it’s easier to read in skript files, in my opinion.

### Will this impact my performance?

This is a Skript library, so any performance impact will be *negligible*.
The **real** performance bottlenecks in Skript projects usually come from how systems are implemented,
not from libraries like this.
Every module in mib_lib has been carefully designed with both readability and efficiency in mind.
